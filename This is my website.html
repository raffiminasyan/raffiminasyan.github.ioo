Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs,
 fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[7][8]</p>
